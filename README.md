## Introduction

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DataSphere Studio (DSS for short) is WeDataSphere, a one-stop data application development management portal developed by WeBank.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the pluggable integrated framework design and the Linkis, a computing middleware, DSS can easily integrate  various upper-layer data application systems, making data development simple and easy to use.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DataSphere Studio is positioned as a data application development portal, and the closed loop covers the entire process of data application development. With a unified UI, the workflow-like graphical drag-and-drop development experience meets the entire lifecycle of data application development from data import, desensitization cleaning, data analysis, data mining, quality inspection, visualization, scheduling to data output applications, etc.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the connection, reusability, and simplification capabilities of Linkis, DSS is born with financial-grade capabilities of high concurrency, high availability, multi-tenant isolation, and resource management.

## Core features

### 1. One-stop, full-process application development management UI

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DSS is highly integrated. Currently integrated components include(**DSS version compatibility for the above components, please visit: [Compatibility list of integrated components](README.md#4-integrated-data-application-components)**):

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**DSS version compatibility for the above components, please visit: [Compatibility list of integrated components](README.md#4-integrated-data-application-components)**.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a pluggable framework architecture, DSS is designed to allow users to quickly integrate new data application tools, or replace various tools that DSS has integrated. For example, replace Scriptis with Zeppelin, and replace Schedulis with DolphinScheduler...

### 2. AppConn, based on Linkis，defines a unique design concept

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AppConn is the core concept that enables DSS to easily and quickly integrate various upper-layer web systems.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AppConn, an application connector, defines a set of unified front-end and back-end three-level integration protocols, allowing external data application systems to easily and quickly becoming a part of DSS data application development. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three-level specifications of AppConn are: the first-level SSO specification, the second-level organizational structure specification, and the third-level development process specification.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DSS arranges multiple AppConns in series to form a workflow that supports real-time execution and scheduled execution. Users can complete the entire process development of data applications with simple drag and drop operations.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since AppConn is integrated with Linkis, the external data application system shares the capabilities of resource management, concurrent limiting, and high performance. AppConn also allows sharable context across system level and thus makes external data application completely gets away from application silos.

### 3. Workspace, as the management unit

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Workspace as the management unit, it organizes and manages business applications of various data application systems, defines a set of common standards for collaborative development of workspaces across data application systems, and provides user role management capabilities.

### 4. Integrated data application components

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DSS has integrated a variety of upper-layer data application systems by implementing multiple AppConns, which can basically meet the data development needs of users.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**If desired, new data application systems can also be easily integrated to replace or enrich DSS's data application development process.** [Click me to learn how to quickly integrate new application systems](https://github.com/WeBankFinTech/DataSphereStudio-Doc/blob/main/en_US/Development_Documentation/Third-party_System_Access_Development_Guide.md)

## Usage Scenarios

 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DataSphere Studio is suitable for the following scenarios:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Scenarios in which big data platform capability is being prepared or initialized but no data application tools are available.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Scenarios in which users already have big data foundation platform capabilities but with only a few data application tools.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Scenarios in which users have the ability of big data foundation platform and comprehensive data application tools, but suffers strong isolation and and high learning costs because those tools have not been integrated together.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Scenarios in which users have the capabilities of big data foundation platform and comprehensive data application tools. but lacks unified and standardized specifications, while a part of these tools have been integrated.
